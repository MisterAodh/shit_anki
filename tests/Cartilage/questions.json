        "answer": "Occurs in low compression movement, uses fluid pressure to create a thin load bearing layer\r\nSqueeze film lubrication: Fluid resists expulsion from bearing gap, taking hydrostatic pressure.\r\nHydrodynamic lubrication: Particle friction drag fluid between cartilage generating upwards hydrostatic pressure.",
